What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	when a git repository is initialized, a hidden file named "git" is created
	on a file system. There is no commit initially.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	working directory and repository is different from staging area as it holds only the files which will be committed in 
	next commit.
	staging area is used to store the files before commit. It makes sense to have staging area as it can store more 
	than one files and we can commit them at once(Logical change).
